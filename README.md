Giselle's Temperature Publisher and Subscriber Node

The task was to create a simple Publisher and Subscriber node in Python using ROS 2.

I created a temperature publisher and subscriber node that reads a given temperature data
and it gives a warning if the temperature is too high or too cold.

The files draw_circle.py, my_first_node.py, and pose_subscriber.py was my first introduction
while following a tutorial. 

Then, I implemented the temperature publisher and subscriber given the knowledge gained from
the tutorial.
